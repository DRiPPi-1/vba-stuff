Problem Statement of Pascal’s Triangle

Figure 1: Pascal's Triangle to the 6th coefficient (check word docx or pdf)
 

Figure 1 is what I’m trying to generate with MATLAB 
and/or VBA. I created the problem myself since I found 
Pascal’s Triangle interesting. Pascal’s Triangle is used 
to find the coefficients of any binomial expression, such 
as (x + y)^n. 
So, if you have the exponent n=1, then the expression is 
(x + y)^1, and you get an expansion of x + y (also written 
as 1x+1y), which has the coefficients 1 & 1 (or 1 1).

n=0: (x + y)^0=1
coefficient=1

n=1: (x +y)^1  =x+y
coefficients=1 1

n=2: (x +y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2
coefficients=1 2 1

n=3: (x + y)^3=x^3+3x^2 y+3xy^2+y^3
coefficients=1 3 3 1

∴ the triangle becomes:

      1
    1   1
  1   2   1
1   3   3   1

I want the user to input any integer, n, to calculate 
the coefficients of the expressions. Maybe later when 
I solved this stage of the problem, I will just find 
the whole expansion of the nth expression.
